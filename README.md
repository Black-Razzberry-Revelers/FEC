# Overview
*DELETE LATER Criteria- The overview should express what we've built in an impressive and complete way in under 30 seconds to someone who isn't trying very hard to understand.*

# Table of Contents
*DELETE LATER Criteria - Links to each section of our Readme that reflect the hierarchy of our Readme*

# Description
*DELETE LATER Criteria- This will be the bulk of our Readme. It's where we can show off how good our project looks and everything that it does. I think we should keep this area highly visual, the goal should be show not tell. Each of us can basically right the readme for the Module which we worked on in the way that best shows it's strengths.*

##  What The Whole App Does
*DELETE LATER Criteria- We'll use this section to talk about app-level features and views, such as style. Things that don't belong to any specific module*

# How the App Works in Technical Terms

##  What Technology We Used / Dependencies
*DELETE LATER- Criteria- We'll be putting a whole list of technologies on our resume. We need a section that proves that we actually know what we know and didn't just pretend.*

##  Usage / Installation
*DELETE LATER - I mostly included this because it's on the learn. I have no grand designs for it, but I trust there's a good reason for it to be here.*

## Design Process
*DELETE LATER - We'll say that we know how to do agile and scrum on our resumes. In this section we'll justify how we built the project and show that we're used to an engineer's workflow, if we decide to keep it.*

## App Logic
*DELETE LATER - We can give a basic overview of how information flows through the app in terms of state and how it interacts with the API. A chance to show that we know how to communicate a technical subject.*

# Who we are and what's the purpose of the project
*DELETE LATER- Criteria - Basically a way to show how involved we were and toot our own horn*

## Contributing members
*DELETE LATER- Links to our githubs, and any other relevant information we'd want to share like linkedin or something*

## Links to our other stuff

# Overview
*DELETE LATER Criteria- The overview should express what we've built in an impressive and complete way in under 30 seconds to someone who isn't trying very hard to understand.*

This directory contains code for a product display page for a fictional ecommerce website called "Shoptopia." Shoptopia is an example of a fully built front end web application. Our code queries an API called Atelier to get dummy product data, displays the data in a branded and dynamic way, and allows for the dynamic and interactive user experience which one would expect for a modern shopping site.

# Table of Contents
*DELETE LATER Criteria - Links to each section of our Readme that reflect the hierarchy of our Readme*

# Description
*DELETE LATER Criteria- This will be the bulk of our Readme. It's where we can show off how good our project looks and everything that it does. I think we should keep this area highly visual, the goal should be show not tell. Each of us can basically right the readme for the Module which we worked on in the way that best shows it's strengths.*

##  What The Whole App Does
*DELETE LATER Criteria- We'll use this section to talk about app-level features and views, such as style. Things that don't belong to any specific module*
##  Product Overview
(Main contributor- Dillon Armstrong)
The Product Overview section of Shoptopia appears at the head of the application. The goal of this component is to display the various styles and images associated with a a product in an attractive way, and to allow a user to share information about the product on social media or take it to checkout.

# How the App Works in Technical Terms
*DELETE LATER Criteria- This is where we can talk about what we did in terms of coding. I'm not totally sure how to divide this up. In this section the motto would be tell, don't show.*

##  What Technology We Used / Dependencies
*DELETE LATER- Criteria- We'll be putting a whole list of technologies on our resume. We need a section that proves that we actually know what we know and didn't just pretend.*

## App Logic
*DELETE LATER - We can give a basic overview of how information flows through the app in terms of state and how it interacts with the API. A chance to show that we know how to communicate a technical subject.*

## Links to our other stuff
*DELETE LATER - Links to other projects by the people on the team, so that people might go check out other cool things we've built.*

## State of the Project
We initially built this application over a 3 week sprint ending on 5/20/23, as part of Hack Reactor's 'Software Engineering Immersive' Program.
Any changes since that time reflect the further efforts of the teammembers to explore and refine their skills as developers.
It is not our intent to
